a copy of the master record of a specific song
an artwork.

Title of the song whose master record is enclosed in the Track;
Total number of Tracks released through the Drop;

The Company reserves the right to publish complementary provisions applicable to the sale mechanism of a specific Track which, if published, are to be deemed incorporated into these Terms by reference.

THE GALA MUSIC PLAYER
The Company offers streaming through the Gala Music Player.

The Gala Music Player relies on a decentralized network of Music Nodes owned and controlled by third parties who agree to pair their Music Nodes and use them at the conditions and for the purposes determined by the Company.

The Gala Music Player is operational as soon as at least two Music Nodes are paired. The more Music Nodes, the more efficient the Gala Music Player becomes allowing more simultaneous streams while maintaining audio quality and speed. The speed and quality also depend on the technical specifications of the machines used by each User to run Music Nodes.

Quality of streaming may further be affected by your location, the speed and bandwidth of your internet service, and the devices you use, among other factors. As a result, the Company is unable to make any warranties about the streaming speed and quality.

PURCHASE OF MUSIC NODES

The Company does not sell Music Nodes. Music Nodes can be purchased directly from Gala Games.

The Company displays information made available by the Gala Games and, through its Platform, provides its Users access to sales conducted thereby. Such sales are not continuous and there may be no Music Nodes available for sale at a given time.

ANY AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE PURCHASE OF MUSIC NODES IS CONCLUDED DIRECTLY WITH GALA GAMES.

The Company does not review nor endorse any liability for this information and the Music Nodes.

CONNECTING MUSIC NODES

To be able to pair Music Nodes, third parties must register as Users on the Platform.

Owners of Music Nodes make them available to the Company as part of the Gala Music Player by pairing them and to this end, clicking on “Activate Player”.
By pairing a Music Node, the User represents and warrants (1) meeting the technical specifications detailed on the Platform to ensure that the Music Node can run adequately and (2) intending to effectively run such Music Node sufficiently often, without undue and repeated on and off times.

Pairing results in granting the Company a sub-license on the Music Node in exchange for royalties paid out in BEAMS.

These royalties are proportional to the actual use of the Music Node as a unit of the Gala Music Player and correspond to share of any royalties due to Track holders. The exact attribution matrix is at all times displayed on the Platform.

PAIRING TRACKS WITH MUSIC NODES

Tracks need to be paired with one of the Music Nodes constituting the Gala Music Player. This is only possible once the Track is integrated by its owner with an NFT.

Process for existing Tracks

The owner of a preexisting Track needs to update it into an NFT using the bridging function made available through the Platform.

Process for new NFTs

Upon mint, the NFT is transferred directly and automatically to the wallet associated with the User’s Account.

For each Track minted as an NFT, the User can proceed with pairing by clicking on one of the following buttons:

“Track Slot Available” for Users having besides paired a Music Node, to pair the NFT directly and by preference with their Music Node.

“Host Selected Track” for Users having not paired a Music Node or whose Music Node has no slots available at the moment of pairing, to pair the NFT with the Music Node run by another User selected randomly.

STREAMING THROUGH MUSIC NODES

As soon as at least one owner paired his/her/its/their Track with the Gala Music Player, the song contained therein is available for streaming.

Some songs could yet be unavailable on the Gala Music Player in the absence of pairings of any Tracks containing the record of the song.

Each Music Node contains an unlimited number of slots with which Tracks can be paired for streaming.

The initial pairing makes 10 slots available per default. More slots can be made available to the Gala Music Player by spending BEAMS. The number of BEAMS to be spent to unlock additional slots is indicated on the Platform and may be at all times amended by the Company.

D. COLLECTING ROYALTIES
Since Track owners hold a license on the neighbouring rights attached to the song master record, anyone who makes public use of the Track, notably by streaming, needs to obtain a sub-license and pay the related royalties.

By pairing a Track, you agree and accept granting such a sub-license to the Company in return for royalties paid out in BEAMS. Such royalties are due only upon the effective stream of the song contained, based on a uniform royalty payment scheme as detailed on the Platform. The amount of royalties due is updated daily and displayed on the Platform.

THE STORE
Any purchase from the Store can only be made with KEYS while KEYS can only be minted by burning BEAMS. The applicable rate is at all times displayed on the Platform at.

KEYS are non-transferrable tokens which can at any time be redeemed against BEAMS.

Each KEY corresponds to a specific number of points which increases as the KEY ages. The number of points associated with each KEY as well as the number of BEAMS burnt to create it, are recorded in the metadata along with its mint date.

Prices in the Store are therefore expressed exclusively in points. The number of KEYS required to purchase a specific item may therefore differ from one User to another, depending on the age of the KEY he/she/it/they hold.
