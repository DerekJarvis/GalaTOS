Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions constitute the User Agreement and Terms of Service (hereafter the “Terms & Conditions”) between music.gala.world (the “Platform”), owned and operated by Blockchain Music Partners, LLC, (referred to collectively as “GALA” or the “Site”) and any person, customer, or entity (referred as the “User”) utilizing the Platform, and any products, features, and services provided thereon (“Platform Services”).

These Terms & Conditions may be amended and updated from time to time with the revised versions being effective as of the date and time posted on the Platform Site. By accessing or using the Platform or purchasing a Platform Asset, you confirm and consent to any revised Terms & Conditions and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. The User is expected and encouraged to review the Terms & Conditions periodically. If the User does not agree to any updated terms included in the Terms & Conditions, the User must not use the Platform or any related Platform services.

1. PLATFORM SERVICES.

1.1 GALA is a decentralized distributed application on a blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart Contract”) to enable its Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be interacted with on the Platform through the GALA App.

Purchases. The Platform may provide Users with the ability to purchase Platform Assets (as defined below) through it’s Platform, Platform Auction (as defined below), or a means other than the Platform or Platform Auction. ANY PURCHASE OR SALE THAT YOU MAKE VIA THE PLATFORM, PLATFORM AUCTION, OR A MEANS OTHER THAN THE PLATFORM OR BY WAY OF PLATFORM AUCTION, OR ANY PRODUCTS, FEATURES, AND SERVICES CONTAINED PROVIDED THEREON, IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, EVEN IF SAID PURCHASE CONTAINS PLATFORM ASSETS OR IS ON THE PLATFORM USING THE PLATFORM AUCTION. NEITHER THE PLATFORM NOR GALA WILL INDEMNIFY OR HOLD THE USER HARMLESS FOR SAID PURCHASE/AUCTION OR OWE ANY LEGAL DUTY OR OBLIGATION TO THE USER. USER BEARS THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF PLATFORM ASSETS PURCHASED ON THE PLATFORM VIA PLATFORM AUCTION OR ANY OTHER MEANS. GALA AND THE PLATFORM MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF PLATFORM ASSETS. USER ALSO AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE LICENSING TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS ACCOMPANYING THE USE OF ANY PURCHASED PLATFORM ASSETS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL OR NON-COMMERCIAL USE (COLLECTIVELY THE “TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS”). USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ABIDING BY THE TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS, AND GALA IS NOT LIABLE IN THE EVENT USER DOES NOT ABIDE BY THE TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS.

1.2 Platform Assets. Platform Assets refer to non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) that are made available via Platform Auction on the Platform by GALA, created and implemented on the Ethereum network or other blockchain platform(s) that the Platform allows, by way of smart contract or otherwise.

1.3 Platform Auction. Platform Auction refers to the sale mechanism supported by the Platform in which Platform Assets are made available for purchase by Users. GALA reserves the right to publish a guide and/or rules surrounding the Platform Auction at any time (including, but not limited to, disclosure of odds related to any individual Platform Auction sale). Said rules, if created, will be incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All transactions via Platform Auction are initiated and fulfilled by ways of Wallet Extensions and decentralized blockchain technology. GALA incorporates by reference the Gala Music Website FAQs.

2. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS AND LICENSE TO ACCESS/DISPLAY PLATFORM SERVICES AND PLATFORM ASSETS

2.1 NFT Ownership. When a User purchases a Platform Asset, the User owns the underlying NFT completely for as long as the User owns the Platform Asset. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the smart contract and Ethereum Network (or any other applicable network): at no point may GALA seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of the Platform Asset. The User acknowledges and agrees that while the User may own a Platform Asset, the underlying embedded intellectual property rights may be subject to certain licensing requirements, and GALA can only convey such rights to Users so long as GALA holds a valid license to the intellectual property. If such license terminates, GALA, and by extension the User, may not have any rights to the underlying embedded intellectual property in the User's owned Platform Asset, and the underlying embedded intellectual property may be changed or removed at GALA's determination.

2.2 Usage and Display Rights. Subject to the continued compliance with the terms and conditions (only where the Platform has the right to offer same AND for only as long as the User still owns the Platform Asset), the User is granted with a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use and display the art and music embedded in and underlying the Platform Asset solely for the following purposes: (1) for the User’s personal, non-commercial use; (2) as a part of the Platform Auction that allows for the purchase and sale of Platform Assets or on the Platform itself (if applicable), or; (3) as the party of a third-party marketplace or application that allows the User to transfer its User’s Platform Asset and permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of the Platform Asset.

2.3 Limitation on Rights. The User agrees and acknowledges the User’s rights in the underlying intellectual property embedded in the Platform Asset may be restricted. By way of example only, an NFT with an embedded song may allow users to listen to the song, but does not allow the User to license the song for use in a motion picture or television series. The User understands and agrees that it is the User’s sole responsibility to understand what rights the User has in any Platform Asset at all times, whether detailed on the Smart Contract, Platform, GALA store page, Gala Music Website FAQs, or any other linked or referenced sales or informational sites. The User further acknowledges and agrees that the User’s rights in the underlying embedded intellectual property are limited to the rights actually conveyed to GALA by the underlying intellectual property holder, and the User does not outright own the underlying intellectual property embedded in any Platform Asset.

3. GALA SERVICES.

3.1 Gala Nodes. The Gala Games Node and Gala Music Node are common names for the Gala Node software (Gala nodes collectively the “GALA Node Network”). The Gala Node software, when combined with a purchased license, allows the Node Operator to operate specific module(s) for the decentralized GALA Node Network. The specific license(s) used to operate the node software allows the operator's hardware to perform various types of work. The work performed by Gala Music Nodes includes securely storing, hosting, and streaming music for the decentralized GALA Node Network to serve to Gala Music listeners all over the world.

3.2 GALA Blockchain. The GALA Blockchain stores items, characters, digital rewards, and other data as a public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. Each User owns the fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (“NFT”) for their items on the GALA Blockchain. When a User purchases, earns, or receives any NFT or digital reward, the User owns the NFT and/or digital reward. For the avoidance of doubt, the User acknowledges and agrees that while the User may own a Platform Asset, the underlying embedded intellectual property rights may be subject to certain licensing requirements, and GALA can only convey such rights to Users so long as GALA holds a valid license to the intellectual property. If such license terminates, GALA, and by extension the User, may not have any rights to the underlying embedded intellectual property in the User's owned Platform Asset, and the underlying embedded intellectual property may be changed or removed at GALA's determination.

3.3 GALA Reward. Each User of the GALA Blockchain, Platform, or Platform Services, may be able to earn or receive the GALA Reward. The “GALA Reward” consists of a representation of GALA token, or other music or game tokens and NFTs, reflected on the GALA Blockchain and/or GALA App and the Site, which may or may not be bridged to other blockchains (including but not limited to Ethereum) through a minting process solely at the option and action of the User.  When referencing the NFTs on the platform themselves in the singular and not specifically as a part of the GALA Reward, same shall be referred to herein as “Platform Asset.” The GALA Reward is a digital reward and not a Security Token. The GALA Reward is not being offered to investors and there is no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to promote the GALA Reward. Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin blockchain), the GALA reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. The GALA Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward may reside solely within the GALA Blockchain, and may or may not have value. GALA cannot, and does not, control whether any of the GALA Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward has monetary value on any other blockchain.  On the GALA Blockchain, the Site, or any associated website, neither the GALA Reward nor NFT nor other digital reward may be exchanged for currency.

The User will not be entitled to any refund or other damages.

9.2. Blockchain Network Risk. The User represents and warrants that the User accepts all blockchain protocol and network risks, including instability, congestion, high transaction costs, network latency, information security, regulatory risk, and technological and operational error. The User understands these risks may result in delays or failure to process transactions and potentially high blockchain transaction fees or third-party fees. The User represents and agrees that the Platform (including GALA) is not responsible for any diminished Platform Services, related features, or capabilities resulting from blockchain network risk. In the event of a material increase or decrease to blockchain transaction fees, third-party fees, or operational degradation, congestion, failure, or other disruption of the blockchain network used by the User, GALA or the Platform may, at its sole discretion and upon notice to the User, make any adjustments to the Platform Services.

9.3. Blockchain Modification Risk. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with blockchain development and code changes.

9.5 Ownership Restrictions. User acknowledges and agrees that GALA, the Platform, any content creator, or third party contact provider (or, as applicable, any licensors) own all legal right, title, and interest in and to all elements of their respective intellectual property rights therein.

The User accepts all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to the Platform Services, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with digital Apps and private keys, including the risks described herein. The User is solely responsible for its conduct while accessing or using the Platform Services and for any consequences thereof.

9.7 Representations Made By User. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Platform Assets ARE NOT being sold as an investment by, or of, Gala nor the Platform.

10. DISCLOSURES & RISKS

10.1 Notification. GALA notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain, NFTs, and cryptocurrency and their associated technology and protocols. Platform Services are not an investment product; under no circumstance, action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by GALA shall be understood or interpreted as such. GALA has no influence whatsoever on any blockchain integrated into the Gala Platform, the transactions, consensus protocols, NFTs, or Wallet Extensions. The ownership of an NFT or use of Platform Services does not represent or constitute any ownership right, stake, share, security, debt, or equivalent privileges. Also inclusive to the statement above, a User's ownership of NFTs does not include the right to receive any form of revenue from participation in or relating to any blockchain or digital reward, including the GALA Blockchain or GALA.

10.2 NFTs. NFTs are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, NFTs are not insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

10.3 Market Risk. The value of NFTs is derived from supply and demand in the global marketplace, which can rise or fall independent of any government currency. Holding NFTs carries exchange rates and other types of risk. The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange traditional government currency for NFTs, resulting in the potential for a permanent and total loss of value of a particular NFT should the market disappear. The volatility and unpredictability of the price and value of NFTs, relative to government currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. GALA cannot guarantee or warrant the value of any NFT or blockchain, including the GALA Blockchain and Platform Assets, and explicitly warns the User that there is no reason to believe that any NFT or blockchain asset will increase in value, hold any value, decrease in value, or entirely lose value.

10.4. Regulatory Risk. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of NFTs. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations, and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology, and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the Platform Services in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial instruments that require registration. GALA may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development of the Platform, or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. The industry in which GALA operates is new and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory, or other similar types of (including banking) authorities will not examine the operations of GALA and/or pursue enforcement actions against GALA. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting GALA in particular. All of this may subject GALA to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or cause GALA to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm GALA’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Platform Services.

10.5 Technology Risk. NFT and blockchain transactions may be irreversible, and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. In addition, some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.

11. DISCLAIMER

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GALA, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. GALA, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE DELETION, FAILURE TO STORE, OR ANY LOSS OF ANY USER DATA, INCLUDING BLOCKCHAIN DATA, NFT, AND DIGITAL REWARDS DERIVED, MAINTAINED, OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE USE OF PLATFORM SERVICES. THE USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING ITS CUSTOMER DATA AND PLATFORM ASSETS. NEITHER GALA, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF PLATFORM SERVICES, GALA BLOCKCHAIN, OR ANY OTHER SUPPORTED BLOCKCHAIN WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. GALA, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR OPPORTUNITY COSTS RESULTING FROM BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK AND PROTOCOL OR THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE ISSUES, WHICH MAY, IN TURN, RESULT IN THE INABILITY TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS ON ANY BLOCKCHAIN AT ALL OR WITHOUT INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL FEES.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

12.1. Limitation of Indirect Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GALA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE USER UNDER THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR LOST REVENUES, OPPORTUNITY COSTS, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF GALA KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF DIRECT DAMAGES DO NOT SATISFY A REMEDY. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO VIOLATIONS OF GALA’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, OR THE USER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

12.2. Limitation of Amount of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER GALA NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS MAY BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE USER TO GALA UNDER THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, MINUS ANY REWARDS GENERATED OR RECEIVED BY THE USER AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF GALA SERVICES.

13. INDEMNIFICATION

Unless prohibited by applicable law, the User will defend and indemnify GALA and its Affiliates against any settlement amounts approved by the User and damages and costs finally awarded against the User and its affiliates by a court of competent jurisdiction in any formal legal proceeding filed by an unaffiliated third party before a court or government tribunal (including any appellate proceeding) to the extent arising from the User’s use of Platform Services.

14. MISCELLANEOUS.

14.1. Assignment. The User will not assign or otherwise transfer the User’s rights and obligations under these Terms & Conditions without the prior written consent of GALA, which may be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this section will be void. At any time and without the need for the User’s consent, GALA may assign any obligation, right, and these Terms & Conditions. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms & Conditions will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The User may not merge these Terms & Conditions with any other agreements with which GALA may be a party.

14.2. Disputes. Any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions or relating in any way to the User’s use of GALA sites or Platform Services, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions the parties may agree to first attempt mediation before a single mediator, administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution under its mediation rules, to be held in any location agreed to by the parties, or Wyoming in the English language. If the parties do not agree on mediation, the matter shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator to be held in Wyoming, USA, administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with International Dispute Resolution Rules. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on the parties and enforceable in a court of competent jurisdiction. The User shall not be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees for the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GALA and the User agree that GALA may bring suit in any court of law to enjoin infringement or other misuses of GALA’s intellectual property rights. Any disputes that may arise beyond the scope of the arbitration provision shall be exclusively subject to the State or Federal Courts located in Wyoming. The User and GALA consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

14.3. Entire Agreement. These Terms & Conditions set out all the terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all other agreements relating to its subject matter. In entering into these Terms & Conditions, neither party has relied on, and neither party will have any right or remedy based on, any statement, representation, or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently), except those expressly set out in these Terms & Conditions. These terms may be updated on GALA sites.

14.4. Force Majeure. GALA and its affiliates will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of an obligation under these Terms & Conditions where the failures or delay results from any cause beyond reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, labor disputes, or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or other telecommunications failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war. Force Majeure events include, but are not limited to, upgrades to the validation rules of a given blockchain (e.g., a “hard fork” or “soft fork”).

14.5. Governing Law. Any claim or dispute between the User and GALA arising out of or relating to the User’s use of GALA sites, Platform Services, or these Terms & Conditions, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions.

14.6. Language. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to these Terms & Conditions must be in English. If we provide a translation of the English language version of these Terms & Conditions, the English version will control any conflict.

14.7. Notices to the User and GALA. GALA may provide any notice to the User under these Terms & Conditions by (i) posting a notice on the GALA Site or the Platform (including via changing the date on this page); or (ii) sending a message to the email address associated with the User’s account. Notices provided on the GALA Site or Platform will be effective upon posting. Notices provided by email will be effective when the email is sent. It is the User’s responsibility to keep the User’s email address current. To give GALA notice under these Terms & Conditions, the User must contact GALA by support@gala.games.
